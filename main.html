	<h1>Time And Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a way to describe how the execution time of an algorithm increases with the size of the input. it helps in analyzing and comparing the efficiency of algorithms.</p>
	<p> <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. when an algorithm has O(n) space complexity, it means the memory required grows linearly with the size of the input.</p>
